# Papers

This folder contains markdown files that are loaded at build time and displayed on the website.

## How It Works

Vite reads all `.md` files from this folder when the site is built. Each file's frontmatter determines whether it appears as a book review, short story, or published work.

## Adding Content

1. Create a new `.md` file in this folder
2. Add frontmatter at the top (see examples below)
3. Write your content below the frontmatter
4. Commit and deploy — the content will appear on the site

## Examples

See the example files in this folder:
- `example-review.md` — Book review
- `example-story.md` — Short story
- `example-published.md` — Published work
